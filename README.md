This repository is a chance to view a stock price versus time in a spiral format.

This idea was proposed by Gann in definition of a square of 9 table to visualize support and resistance angles as defined by the square of 9 location superimposed upon a 360-degree circle.

For example,

  all squares of even numbers: 4, 16, 36, 64 all fall on the 135-degree angle.
and,
  all squares of odd numbers:  1, 9, 25, 49, 81 fall on the 315-degree angle.

With that, attached below is an example of that calculation.

This second image is a screenshot render of prices plotted upon the spiral as downloaded from the a djia api, last 100 days of trade.

I selected the price range between $3000 and $3100 for purpose of simplifiying the visulization of price movement.

The stock has been trading in the +/- $3000 range during the last 100 days.

Green dots are price up for the day.

Red dots are price down for the day.

Clockwise rotation is price increase. Blue pie indicates price increased for the day, usually from a red dot.

Counter-clockwise is price decrease.  Red pie indicates a price decrease for the day, usually from a green dot.
