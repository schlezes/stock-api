This repository is a chance to view a stock price versus time in a spiral format.

This idea was proposed by Gann in definition of a square of 9 table to visualize support and resistance angles as defined by the square of 9 location superimposed upon a 360-degree circle.

For example,

  all squares of even numbers: 4, 16, 36, 64 all fall on the 135-degree angle.
and,
  all squares of odd numbers:  1, 9, 25, 49, 81 fall on the 315-degree angle.

With that, attached below is an example of that calculation.

Clockwise rotation is price increase. Blue pie indicates price increased for the day, usually from a red dot.

Counter-clockwise is price decrease.  Red pie indicates a price decrease for the day, usually from a green dot.

Green dots are price up for the day.

Red dots are price down for the day.
